* Cl-Underfoot 

** Usage

** Installation

A reboot of my underfoot project in Common Lisp.

** Quicklisp

This project uses quicklisp to manage and install dependencies. It can be installed via most package managers see here [[https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/getting-started.html][quicklisp]]. On arch and manjaro the instructions will have a path error. The path will be wrong.

#+begin_src common-lisp

(load "/usr/share/common-lisp/source/quicklisp/quicklisp.lisp")
(quicklisp-quickstart:install)

;; Should be replaced by

(load "/usr/share/quicklisp/quicklisp.lisp")
(quicklisp-quickstart:install)

#+end_src
